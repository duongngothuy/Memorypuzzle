# Memory Puzzle Game

This project implements a classic Memory Puzzle Game using Python and Pygame.

## Methodology

The project follows these main steps:

1. **Game Setup:**
   - Initializing the game window and setting up game parameters.
   - Creating a board with randomly placed pairs of shapes and colors.

2. **Game Logic:**
   - Handling user input for selecting puzzle pieces.
   - Implementing the logic for matching pairs and revealing/hiding pieces.

3. **Game State Management:**
   - Keeping track of revealed boxes and matched pairs.
   - Managing game progress and win condition.

4. **Rendering:**
   - Drawing the game board, shapes, and UI elements.
   - Updating the display based on game state.

## Results

The result is an interactive Memory Puzzle Game where players can:
- lick on boxes to reveal shapes.
- Match pairs of shapes to clear the board.
- Win the game by matching all pairs.

## Usage

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   - Python 3.x
   - Pygame

2. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/duongngothuy/Memorypuzzle.git`

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   `cd Memorypuzzle`

4. Run the game:
   `python memorypuzzle.py`

5. Play the game:
   - Click on boxes to reveal shapes.
   - Try to match pairs of identical shapes.
   - Clear the entire board to win.
   
## Future Work

- Implement difficulty levels (e.g., more shapes, larger board).
- Add a scoring system and timer.
- Create a menu system for game options.
